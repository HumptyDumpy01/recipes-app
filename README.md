# Recipe Tech Task

This repository contains the frontend and backend components for a recipe application.

## Structure

* **backend/**: Contains the NestJS backend application. Refer to `backend/README.md` for instructions on installation,
  setup, and running the backend.
* **frontend/**: Contains the Next.js frontend application. Refer to `frontend/README.md` for instructions on
  installation, setup, and running the frontend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend/` folder and follow the instructions in `backend/README.md` to set up and run the backend
   API.
3. Navigate to the `frontend/` folder and follow the instructions in `frontend/README.md` to set up and run the frontend
   application.

Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend, as the frontend relies on the backend API to fetch recipe
data.
